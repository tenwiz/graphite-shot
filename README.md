## Graphite Shot

#### Motivation

There are quite a few tools to create nice looking images from code. Some examples that inspired this tool are:
 - [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh)
 - [Polacode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pnp.polacode)
 - [Codeimg](https://codeimg.io/)
 
 But all of these require that you actually write the code in them. I wanted something where I could write my code in the editor and just add the fancy window to the screenshot.
 Graphite Shot lets you do just that.
 
 #### Features
 
 - Drop, Paste or use dialog to select your image.
 - Automatically choose the window color based on the most common color of the image
 - Change window and background colors

#### Dev

React App with Typescript and Styled-Components.
